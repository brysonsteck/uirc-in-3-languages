# `uirc` In Three Languages 

[uirc](https://github.com/brysonsteck/uirc) is a command-line program that allows users to calculate the ratio of an image, located on the user's file system or on a web server. This repository is a collection of three different implementations of uirc in three different languages, all three of which is based on the original code as of commit [40ef9f33ba](https://github.com/brysonsteck/uirc/tree/40ef9f33ba16265e7f0dddb625fa94ad4d2b5afe):

1. C (The original language uirc is written in)
1. Go (Widely described as "C with garbage collection")
1. Rust ([The most popular compiled language](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-language-love-dread) with similar functional features and types as C and Go)

With these different implementations of uirc, it will be able to test how modern languages with similar features stack up to the most influential programming language of all time (but that is also over 50 years old) in the following ways:

* Project setup
  * Language installation
  * Creating the code
  * Compilation
  * Package/Library installation
* File size
  * Lines of code
  * Size of binaries
  * Size of each directory
* Speed
  * Compile time
  * Runtime (using `time` on Linux) using multiple inputs
